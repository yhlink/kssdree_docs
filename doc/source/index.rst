Welcome to Kssdtree documentation!

Kssdtree is a versatile Python package for phylogenetic analysis, including three different workflows: routine pipeline, reference subtraction pipeline and phylogenetic placement pipeline. The routine pipeline serves as a versatile tool for general-purpose phylogenetic analysis of users' genomic data.  The reference subtraction pipeline designs for intra-species phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic placement pipeline facilitates the search for similar genomes in the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB). It conducts phylogenetic analysis alongside these similar genomes and positions the input genomes within the entire prokaryotic tree of life.

It also provides one-stop tree construction and visualization. It can handle DNA sequences of both fasta or fastq format, whether gzipped or not. Kssdtree can run on multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, and MacOS).
